    title: "Oliver Solomon (Son) with Swapna",
    description: "I felt really privileged to sketch my son, Oliver Solomon, alongside his mom, Swapna. This piece was one of the most challenging I've ever worked on—not just because it's a double portrait, but because capturing two faces together adds a whole new level of complexity. There are tiny details, subtle expressions, and trying to get the likeness just right for both of them took a lot of focus and patience. I spread the work out over five and a half months, totaling around 84 hours. Some days I'd work for hours and barely make progress, just because I wanted it to be perfect. Other days, I'd suddenly find a groove and see the sketch really coming to life. But more than just the technical challenges, working on this meant a lot to me personally. So much love and connection in one piece—and it's almost like every hour spent was worth it to capture that feeling between mother and son.",

    title: "Oliver Solomon (Son) with Sateesh",
    description: "I feel truly lucky to have been able to draw a sketch of myself with my son, Oliver Solomon. The photo I used as a reference was a selfie I took when Oliver was just two months old—a very precious memory for me. This sketch is especially meaningful because it’s my very first attempt at drawing my own portrait, and getting the details right was both challenging and rewarding. I worked on the sketch bit by bit whenever I could find the time, sometimes late at night or during quiet moments at home. Altogether, I spent about 48 hours over the span of four months to finish it. Seeing the final result was a proud moment, as it captures not just our faces, but also a special time in our lives that I will always cherish.",

    title: "Boggarapu Surya Kumari (Mother)",
    description: "I felt truly honored to create a sketch of my mother, using one of her photos from the 1980s as my reference. That old photograph is one of my favorites, capturing her youthful energy and warmth. I decided to turn it into a special gift for her 60th birthday, hoping it would bring back fond memories from her past. Working on the sketch was a heartfelt experience for me. I dedicated time to it whenever I could—sometimes after work or during quiet weekends—focusing on every little detail to make sure it captured her spirit. All together, I spent about 45 hours on this portrait over the course of two months and ten days. Presenting the finished sketch to my mother on her milestone birthday was a truly memorable moment, and seeing her joy made all the effort worthwhile.",

    title: "Juliana",
    description: "I created this sketch of Juliana, a sweet and cheerful girl from my church in Dublin, Ireland. She has always stood out to me with her bright smile and kind personality, which made me want to capture her likeness in a drawing. The process was quite a journey—I spent a total of 76 hours on the sketch, spreading the work over about four months. One of the biggest challenges was drawing her hair, as it had so much detail and texture that took a lot of time and patience to get right. Even though it was a lot of work, I really enjoyed the experience. Finishing the sketch felt very rewarding, and I was happy to be able to share it with Juliana and others in our church community. It’s special for me not just as an artwork, but as a way to celebrate the people around me.",

    title: "African Boy",
    description: "I found a captivating photo of an African child while browsing the internet, and I felt inspired to turn it into a sketch. There was something special about the child’s expression that really caught my attention, and I wanted to try capturing that feeling with my drawing. Working on this sketch was both challenging and rewarding. I dedicated about 55 hours to the artwork, gradually making progress over the course of roughly three months. I would spend time on it whenever I could, fitting in a few hours here and there during my busy schedule.This project pushed me to experiment with new techniques and pay close attention to the details, especially in capturing the subtle emotions on the child’s face. Completing the sketch felt like an accomplishment, and it reminded me how art can connect us—even with people we’ve never met—through a simple image.",

    description: "I created a sketch based on a photograph of my father from the 1980s, a time that really captures who he was in his younger days. I chose this picture because it’s one of my favorites, filled with memories and stories from his past. I decided to make this sketch as a special gift to celebrate his 60th birthday, hoping it would bring back fond memories for him. The entire process took about 42 hours, spread out over two months. I worked on it whenever I found the time, carefully focusing on the details to make sure I did justice to the original photo. The experience was both challenging and meaningful, as I felt connected to my father’s history with each stroke. When I finally finished and presented the sketch to my dad on his birthday, it was a proud and emotional moment for both of us. Creating this artwork allowed me to honor him in a unique way, and seeing his reaction made all the effort worthwhile.",

    title: "Swapna (Spouse)",
    description: "After taking a break from sketching for about two years, I decided to pick up my pencils again for a very special reason—to create a portrait of my better half, Swapna. It felt meaningful to return to art with her as my inspiration, and I wanted to capture her likeness in a way that would express how much she means to me. Working on this sketch was a rewarding experience, although it came with its own challenges. I dedicated about 60 hours to completing it, spreading the work out over the course of two months. One of the toughest parts was drawing her hair, as it required a lot of patience and close attention to detail to capture the texture and natural flow just right. I found myself carefully working section by section, determined to make the hair look as realistic as possible.",

After spending a long time working on it, I was finally able to complete the portrait, which took me about 48 hours in total. There were moments when I struggled with the details, but seeing the finished result made all the effort worthwhile. This sketch is also special to me because it’s the very first drawing I did in a new sketchbook that was gifted to me by a friend. That thoughtful gift motivated me to get started, and I’m really grateful for the encouragement.",

    title: "Old Women",
    description: "This is my favorite—and by far the most complex—sketch that I’ve created so far. The portrait was a real challenge, mainly because of the many intricate details; the deep wrinkles on the face, the textured hair, and the folds of the clothing all demanded a lot of attention and patience. Capturing the character and emotion in the elderly woman’s expression was especially meaningful for me. I dedicated about 60 hours to working on this artwork, carefully building up each layer to make sure the textures looked as realistic as possible. Every stroke on the paper pushed me to refine my skills, and it became a project that tested my patience and determination. Seeing the finished piece makes me feel very proud, as it represents both the complexity of the subject and the progress I’ve made as an artist.",

I was drawn to this subject because of the rich character in his face—the deep lines, expressive eyes, and the detailed textures of his hat and shirt. These elements made the sketch both challenging and exciting to work on. Taking on such a detailed drawing pushed me out of my comfort zone, especially as I worked to capture the subtle shadows and unique features that give this portrait so much personality. Completing this sketch gave me a sense of achievement, and it marked an important step in my journey as an artist. ",

    description: "This sketch holds a special place in my collection, as it was the very first time I tried drawing two faces together in one portrait. The reference image came from a newspaper advertisement for Hutch Mobile network, and I was instantly drawn to the joyful expressions and the sense of connection between the two people. Taking on two faces in a single sketch brought its own set of challenges. I had to work carefully to capture each person's unique features while also making sure their expressions and proportions looked natural together. Getting the smiles and eyes just right took a lot of patience and attention to detail. Completing this piece was a rewarding accomplishment for me. It helped me grow as an artist and gave me the confidence to take on more complex subjects in the future. ",

The sketch is done entirely in graphite pencil, focusing on soft shading, sharp contrasts, and smooth gradients to bring out the depth in facial features. The highlights in the eyes, subtle shading on the cheeks, and the fine details in the hair and jewelry reflect my early exploration of realism. Despite being my initial attempt, the artwork captures a strong expression with a natural flow.",
