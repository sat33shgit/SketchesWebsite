# 🐛 Comment Count Update Fix

## Problem
When a new comment was added to a sketch, the comment count displayed in the sidebar (and gallery) wasn't updating automatically. Users had to refresh the page to see the updated count.

## Root Cause
The application had two separate components managing comment data:
- `CommentsSection` - Handles adding new comments and displays the comments list
- `CommentCount` - Displays the comment count in the sidebar/gallery

These components were independent of each other, so when `CommentsSection` added a comment, `CommentCount` had no way of knowing to refresh its count.

## Solution
Implemented a **custom event system** to enable communication between components:

### 1. Updated `CommentsSection.jsx`
- After successfully posting a comment, dispatches a custom `commentAdded` event
- Passes the `sketchId` in the event detail for targeted updates

```javascript
// Dispatch custom event to notify CommentCount components to refresh
const commentAddedEvent = new CustomEvent('commentAdded', {
  detail: { sketchId: sketchId }
});
window.dispatchEvent(commentAddedEvent);
```

### 2. Updated `CommentCount.jsx` 
- Added event listener for `commentAdded` events
- When event is received for the same `sketchId`, refreshes the count
- Properly cleans up event listener on component unmount

```javascript
// Listen for comment updates
const handleCommentUpdate = (event) => {
  if (event.detail && event.detail.sketchId === sketchId) {
    loadCount()
  }
}

window.addEventListener('commentAdded', handleCommentUpdate)
```

### 3. Updated `Gallery.jsx`
- Added similar event listener to refresh gallery comment counts
- Ensures consistency across all views that display comment counts

## Benefits
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Comment counts update immediately after posting
✅ **No Page Refresh Required** - Seamless user experience  
✅ **Multiple Views Supported** - Works in both sidebar and gallery views
✅ **Targeted Updates** - Only refreshes count for the specific sketch
✅ **Clean Architecture** - No tight coupling between components

## How It Works
1. User posts a comment in `CommentsSection`
2. Comment is successfully saved to database
3. `CommentsSection` refreshes its own comments list
4. `CommentsSection` dispatches `commentAdded` event with sketch ID
5. All `CommentCount` components listening for that sketch ID automatically refresh
6. Gallery comment counts also refresh via the same event
7. User sees updated count immediately

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Navigate to any sketch detail page
2. Note the current comment count in the sidebar
3. Post a new comment
4. Verify that the comment count in the sidebar updates immediately
5. Navigate back to gallery and verify count is also updated there

This fix ensures a seamless, real-time commenting experience across the entire application! 🎉
