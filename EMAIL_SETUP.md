# Email Service Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup with Web3Forms (Recommended - Free & Easy)

1. Go to https://web3forms.com/
2. Enter your email: `bsateeshk@gmail.com`
3. Click "Create Access Key"
4. Copy the access key you receive
5. Replace the test key in `src/utils/emailService.js`:
   ```javascript
   access_key: 'YOUR_ACTUAL_ACCESS_KEY_HERE' // Replace this line
   ```

## Testing the Current Setup

The current implementation:
- ✅ Uses a test access key that logs submissions to console
- ✅ Provides fallback handling if the service fails
- ✅ Shows proper success/error messages to users
- ✅ Works immediately for testing purposes

## Alternative Services (if Web3Forms doesn't work)

### Option 1: Formspree
1. Go to https://formspree.io/
2. Create account and verify `bsateeshk@gmail.com`
3. Create a form and get the form ID
4. Update the endpoint in emailService.js

### Option 2: EmailJS
1. Go to https://emailjs.com/
2. Set up Gmail integration
3. Create email template
4. Update configuration in emailService.js

## Current Status
- Form works locally with fallback logging
- Ready for production once you add your Web3Forms access key
- All user interface and error handling is complete
